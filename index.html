        <h2>Golden Kamuy</h2>
        <div>In early 1900s Hokkaido after the Russo-Japanese war, Saichi Sugimoto tirelessly pans for gold. 
        Nicknamed "Sugimoto the Immortal" for his death-defying acts in battle, 
        the ex-soldier seeks fortune in order to fulfill a promise made to his best friend before he was killed in action: 
        to support his family, especially his widow who needs treatment overseas for her deteriorating eyesight. 
        One day, a drunken companion tells Sugimoto the tale of a man who murdered a group of Ainu and stole a fortune in gold. 
        Before his arrest by the police, he hid the gold somewhere in Hokkaido. 
        The only clue to its location is the coded map he tattooed on the bodies of his cellmates in exchange for a share of the treasure, 
        should they manage to escape and find it.
        Sugimoto does not think much of the tale until he discovers the drunken man’s corpse bearing the same tattoos described in the story. 
        But before he can collect his thoughts, a grizzly bear—the cause of the man's demise—approaches Sugimoto, intent on finishing her meal. 
        He is saved by a young Ainu girl named Asirpa, whose father happened to be one of the murdered Ainu. 
        With Asirpa's hunting skills and Sugimoto's survival instincts, 
        the pair agree to join forces and find the hidden treasure—one to get back what was rightfully her people's, 
        and the other to fulfill his friend's dying wish.</div>

        <h2>JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken</h2>
        <div>In 1868, Dario Brando saves the life of an English nobleman, George Joestar. 
        By taking in Dario's son Dio when the boy becomes fatherless, George hopes to repay the debt he owes to his savior. 
        However Dio, unsatisfied with his station in life, aspires to seize the Joestar house for his own. 
        Wielding an Aztec stone mask with supernatural properties, he sets out to destroy George and his son, Jonathan "JoJo" Joestar, 
        and triggers a chain of events that will continue to echo through the years to come.
        Half a century later, in New York City, Jonathan's grandson Joseph Joestar discovers the legacy his grandfather left for him. 
        When an archeological dig unearths the truth behind the stone mask, he realizes that he is the only one who can defeat the Pillar Men, 
        mystical beings of immeasurable power who inadvertently began everything.
        Adapted from the first two arcs of Hirohiko Araki's outlandish manga series, 
        JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken follows the many thrilling expeditions of JoJo and his descendants. 
        Whether it's facing off with the evil Dio, or combatting the sinister Pillar Men, 
        there's always plenty of bizarre adventures in store.</div>

        <h2>KonoSuba</h2>
        <div>After dying a laughable and pathetic death on his way back from buying a game, 
        high school student and recluse Kazuma Satou finds himself sitting before a beautiful but obnoxious goddess named Aqua. 
        She provides the NEET with two options: continue on to heaven or reincarnate in every gamer's dream—a real fantasy world! 
        Choosing to start a new life, Kazuma is quickly tasked with defeating a Demon King who is terrorizing villages. 
        But before he goes, he can choose one item of any kind to aid him in his quest, and the future hero selects Aqua. 
        But Kazuma has made a grave mistake—Aqua is completely useless!
        Unfortunately, their troubles don't end here; it turns out that living in such a world is far different from how it plays out in a game. 
        Instead of going on a thrilling adventure, the duo must first work to pay for their living expenses. 
        Indeed, their misfortunes have only just begun!</div>

        <h2>K-On!</h2>
        <div>A fresh high school year always means much to come, and one of those things is joining a club. 
        Being in a dilemma about which club to join, Yui Hirasawa stumbles upon and applies for the Light Music Club, 
        which she misinterprets to be about playing simple instruments, such as castanets. 
        Unable to play an instrument, she decides to visit to apologize and quit.
        Meanwhile, the Light Music Club faces disbandment due to a lack of members. 
        This causes the club members to offer anything, from food to slacking off during club time, in order to convince Yui to join. 
        Despite their efforts, Yui insists on leaving due to her lack of musical experience. 
        As a last resort, they play a piece for Yui, which sparks her fiery passion and finally convinces her to join the club.
        From then onward, it's just plain messing around with bits and pieces of practice. 
        The members of the Light Music Club are ready to make their time together a delightful one!</div>

        <h2>Girls & Panzer</h2>
        <div>"Senshadou" is a traditional sport using World War II era tanks in elimination-based matches. 
        Widely practiced by women and girls alike, it's advertised as a form of art geared towards making 
        ladies more prominent in culture and appealing to men. Becoming a worldwide phenomenon over time, 
        the influence of senshadou leads to the creation of a world championship which will soon be held in Japan.
        Miho Nishizumi, who comes from a lineage of well-respected senshadou specialists, 
        is at odds with the sport after a traumatic event led to her retirement and eventually a rift to form between her and her family. 
        To steer clear of the practice as much as possible, 
        she transfers to Ooarai Girls High School where the senshadou program has been abolished. 
        However, with the news of the upcoming championships, the school revives their tankery program, and Miho is pushed into joining.
        Now, with the aid of some new friends, she must overcome her past and once again take command of 
        a squadron of tanks in an effort to save her school from closure, 
        all while proving to her family that the Nishizumi-style of senshadou is not solely about victory.</div>
